/*:
## Exercise - Memberwise and Custom Initializers
 
 If you completed the exercise Structs, Instances, and Default Values, you created a `GPS` struct with default values for properties of `latitude` and `longitude`. Create your `GPS` struct again, but this time do not provide default values. Both properties should be of type `Double`.
 */

//:  In Structs, Instance, and Default Values, you also created a `Book` struct with properties `title`, `author`, `pages`, and `price`. Create this struct again without default values. Give each property the appropriate type. Declare your `favoriteBook` instance and pass in the values of your favorite book using the memberwise initializer. Print a statement about your favorite book using `favoriteBook`'s properties.


//:  Now create a variable instance of `Height` called `someonesHeight`. Use the initializer for inches to set the height to 65. Print out the property for height in centimeters and verify that it is equal to 165.1.

//:  Now create a variable instance of `Height` called `myHeight` and initialize it with your own height. Verify that both `heightInInches` and `heightInCentimeters` are accurate.
